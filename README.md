<p> Stonkfish is a Rust-based variant chess engine designed to play on a wide range of board sizes and piece types, offering greater flexibility than traditional chess engines.</p>

<p> Currently under development to be played on the web as a part of <a href="https://github.com/vishnkr/varchess"> Varchess </a> taking advantage of Rust's WebAssembly support. The engine is planned to include custom material evaluation, alpha-beta pruning, and some kind of dynamically generated piece square tables (which may not be implemented if the evaluation benefits are minimal).</p>
